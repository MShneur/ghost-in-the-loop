## Boot Contract (v8.2.0 — transactional)

`safeBoot()` waits for `document.body`, then runs boot as isolated phases:

- **Critical** (`styles → panel → render`): a failure throws → `_gitlFatal()`
  (beacon `error:boot` + visible banner + `GM_notification`). The panel is the
  product; if it can't render, fail LOUD, never blank+silent.
- **Optional** (`continue-observer, heartbeat, tab-lock, bus, panel-sentinel,
  boot-retry, prior-error-surface`): each caught; a failure pushes to
  `GHOST._degraded` + Timeline `boot_phase{ok:false}` and is logged, but can
  never suppress the panel or later phases.
- The singleton `window.__GITL_V8__` is set to `true` **only after** the
  critical phases succeed (a failed attempt no longer blocks a same-page retry;
  an in-flight marker prevents concurrent double-exec).

**Boot beacon** (`<html data-gitl-boot>`): `started` → `ok:<ver>` |
`no-panel:<ver>` | `error:<stage>` | `remounted:N` | `sentinel-open`. Visible in
a plain page-save — the primary field diagnostic.

**Panel sentinel** (`startPanelSentinel`): treats the panel as down when
disconnected OR `display:none`/`visibility:hidden`/zero-size; re-mounts (same
node, state intact); capped 5/30s with a circuit breaker + visible note.
Safe because Ghost never hides its own root (collapse hides only `.g-body`).

**GITL_NET.install()** runs at top level (before `safeBoot`, so it beats the
page's first fetch). Every patch is individually try/caught + the whole method
+ its call site — a hardened page can cost only its own network telemetry,
never the panel.

## Testing engines

E2e runs in **Chromium and Firefox** (`playwright.config.js` advertises the
Firefox project when a Firefox build is present; CI installs both). Firefox is
desktop Gecko — the engine that enforces Trusted Types — not Android GeckoView,
so passes are Gecko-validated, not Android-certified.

---

## Element Lookup and Authority (v8.3)

Input and actuator lookup intentionally have different authority:

1. **Composer observation** — `Adapter.getInput()` tries reviewed profile
   selectors, a previously learned unique read/write composer locator, then a
   role/meaning heuristic. Composer locators may be learned in a 12-host LRU.
2. **Reviewed Send authority** — `Adapter.getSendBtn()` calls `_reviewedSend()`.
   The platform must be marked reviewed, and a configured selector must resolve
   to exactly one visible, enabled, veto-safe element.
3. **Diagnostic Send candidate** — `_heurSend()` may identify a likely control
   for the probe/report, but that element is never clicked.
4. **No actuator memory** — `SelectorMemory.learn('send', …)` and
   `lookup('send')` delete the entry and return `null`.
5. **Cross-cutting veto** — `_sendLooksSafe()` rejects popup toggles, structural
   mismatches, and message-action controls such as Copy/Share/Attach.

`reDetect()` is retrying (12 s MutationObserver + interval) and clears all
caches including the heuristic tier's; a `visibilitychange` handler silently
drops caches when the cached composer is found detached.

Generic/custom sites may receive injected text but remain manual-send until an
adapter is reviewed. Compatibility cannot silently grant actuator authority.

## Signal Engine Contract

**Function:** `detectSignal(fullText) → { signal, confidence, progress }`

**Scoring (additive, not exclusive):**

```
Sigil HALT     [[GITL::HALT]]      hScore += 4
Sigil PROCEED  [[GITL::PROCEED]]   pScore += 4
Legacy HALT    SYSTEM_HALT         hScore += 3  (only if sigil absent)
Legacy PROCEED PROCEED             pScore += 3  (only if sigil absent — see Bug 1 in DEVLOG)
Fuzzy HALT     e.g. "task complete" hScore += 2
Fuzzy PROCEED  e.g. "shall i cont." pScore += 2
Custom HALT    user-defined         hScore += 2
Custom PROCEED user-defined         pScore += 2
Progress mid   [Step N of M] N<M    pScore += 2
Progress final [Step N of M] N≥M    hScore += 1
```

**Decision (HALT-FIRST — inviolable):**
```
hScore ≥ 3 AND hScore ≥ pScore  →  halt
pScore ≥ 3                       →  proceed
otherwise                        →  none
```

**⚠ Known footgun:** `LEGACY_PROCEED = 'PROCEED'` is a substring of `[[GITL::PROCEED]]`. The `else-if` guard in the legacy check must never be removed. See DEVLOG.md Bug 1.

---

## Tab Lock Protocol

**Key format:** `gitl:lock:{hostname}:{first 3 pathname segments}`

**Claim:** write `{tabId, ts}` JSON to GM storage. Succeeds if the key is empty,
expired (>8s), or owned by this tab.

**Pre-actuator verification:** `verifyTabLease()` claims, yields for a short
jitter, then re-reads the key. If two tabs raced from an empty lock, only the
last stored owner reaches the button click.

**Heartbeat:** every 5s via `startTabHeartbeat()`. If claim fails during heartbeat, loop is paused.

**Release:** `beforeunload` event. Must clear own entry only — never clear another tab's lock.

**`assertInteractionSafe()`:** called before every `engineSend()`. Returns `{ok, reason}`. Reasons: `ok`, `tab-not-focused`, `tab-lock-held-by-other`.

---

## Send Transaction Contract (v8.3, refined v8.7)

`engineSend()` has one authorized dispatch path: resolve the composer
(ambiguous-visible-composer → loud pause, `COMPOSER-003`), inject, **verify the
composer holds the staged prompt** (evidence gate, `COMPOSER-002`), verify the
tab lease, select exactly one reviewed mechanism from the tier ladder, and fire
it once.

The **send tier ladder** (`_selectSendStrategy`, v8.7) chooses BEFORE the
journal opens: human-taught control → unique reviewed button (uniqueness across
the whole reviewed selector set; >1 live candidate → loud `SEND-004`) →
reviewed Enter fallback (adapter-declared) → reviewed `form.requestSubmit()`
(adapter-declared, single veto-safe form wrapping the composer; currently
inert). A reviewed control that is present but disabled after staging is its
own loud state (`SEND-003`). No strategy → `SEND-001`, prompt left for manual
Send. **Dry-run mode** (v8.7) stops after tier selection: no journal, no
dispatch, loud pause.

The journal state is:

```
dispatching → committed
           ↘ uncertain → committed | failed  (human reconciliation only)
           ↘ failed
```

- `_beginSendAttempt()` records a command id and pre-dispatch observations.
- `_confirmSend()` is the only automatic state transition that increments
  `round` or advances roadmap/workflow state.
- `_sendEvidence()` accepts an assistant DOM transition, or composer-cleared
  plus a visible generation control/trusted correlated network pulse.
- A network pulse alone, a cleared composer alone, or elapsed time never proves
  delivery.
- `_markSendUncertain()` pauses, creates `SEND-002`, and does not retry.
- Crash recovery restores interrupted `dispatching` work as `uncertain`; it
  never replays the command.

Do not reintroduce post-dispatch Enter, form-submit, refocus, multi-click, or
retry fallbacks. Additional mechanisms may only join the ladder as
**pre-journal selections**. At-most-once behavior is a product invariant, not
a temporary compatibility tradeoff.

## Safety Switches (v8.7)

- **Kill switch** (`killSwitch`, global) and **per-site disable** (`gitlSiteOff`
  map): checked in `assertInteractionSafe()` (every send), at the top of
  `engineTick()` (a mid-run flip pauses loud), and in `startLoop`/`startQueue`.
- **Dry run** (`dryRun`): every gate and staging step runs; actuation is
  withheld. The would-be path is recorded (`dry_run_dispatch`) and the loop
  pauses loud.
- All three default OFF and ride config backup/restore (`CONFIG_KEYS`).

## Net Read Prototype (v8.7, off by default)

Settings → Advanced → **Net read** (`netRead`) taps the platform's own stream
content via `GITL_NET` — currently ChatGPT SSE (`/backend-api/conversation`
and `/backend-api/f/conversation`): full-message snapshots, JSON-patch ops on
`/message/content/parts/N`, and the `[DONE]` sentinel. Evidence is
round-scoped (`resetStream()` at each `_beginSendAttempt`), in-memory only,
and **read-only by contract test**: never persisted, never in reports, never
consulted by actuation or send authority. The DOM completion gate stays the
independent authority.

---

## Platform Adapter Protocol

Each platform entry in `PROFILES{}` must have:

```js
{
  label: 'PlatformName',          // shown in UI
  host:  ['domain.com'],          // matched against location.hostname
  input: ['selector1', 'sel2'],   // tried in order, first match wins
  send:  ['selector1', 'sel2'],
  stop:  ['selector1', 'sel2'],
  assistant: ['selector1'],       // message elements
  inject: 'contenteditable'|'value'|'textarea',
  // optional:
  apiExport: async () => {},       // platform-native export if available
}
```

`Adapter.getInput()` tries each selector in `PLAT.input[]` until one matches.
`Adapter.injectText(el, text)` uses the `inject` mode to set text without destroying editor state.

**⚠ Never use `innerHTML = ''` on platform input elements.** Destroys ProseMirror state on Claude and Perplexity. Use `replaceChildren()` or target only the GITL panel.

---

## Workshop Layer (community content)

Custom personas & workflows live in the `Workshop` module, layered on top of the immutable built-in `PERSONA_LIBRARY` / `WORKFLOW_LIBRARY` constants.

**Read path:** all consumers go through `allPersonas()` / `allWorkflows()`, which return `Object.assign({}, BUILTINS, Workshop.<store>)`. Built-ins always win on key collision at read time; the store is merged on top only for distinct keys. Never read the raw `*_LIBRARY` constant for resolution/UI — always the accessor — or custom items vanish.

**Stores:** `Workshop.personas` / `Workshop.workflows`, persisted as JSON under GM keys `customPersonas` / `customWorkflows` (both in `GM_KEYS`). Loaded once in `safeBoot` via `Workshop.load()`.

**Invariants (enforced + unit-tested in `tests/workshop.test.js`):**
- Built-in ids are immutable. `importBundle`/`addX` seed the "taken" set with built-in keys, so a clashing import is auto-renamed (`researcher` → `researcher_2`), never an overwrite.
- Import requires exact schema and field sets. The entire bundle validates before
  any state changes; one invalid item rejects the batch.
- Safety caps in `WORKSHOP_LIMITS`: 512 KB file (checked before `JSON.parse`),
  200 items, label 40, inject 4000, desc 200, stage 2000, and ≤20 stages.
- Writes are staged. If any persistence step fails, prior memory/storage values
  are restored.
- All custom text is rendered through `_esc()` before interpolation into panel `innerHTML`. Imported strings are untrusted — without this they could inject markup into Ghost's own UI.

**Bundle format** (`exportBundle`):
`{ schema:'gitl-workshop/1', tool, version, exported, personas:[{id,label,inject}], workflows:[{id,label,desc,stages[]}], skin? }`.
`schema` is mandatory and unknown top-level/item fields are rejected.

**UI:** create forms + ★-badged custom items with tap-twice delete in Roles (personas) and Flow (workflows); shared `⬆ Import / ⬇ Export / 🌐 Share` row in both; Share deep-links to the `workshop` help section (GitHub Discussions + `workshop`-tagged issue submission).

## Extension Build Process

`extension/content.js` is built from `ghost-in-the-loop.user.js` via:

```bash
npm run build
npm run check:generated
```

`scripts/build-extension.js` finds the userscript metadata terminator, takes the
runtime verbatim, and wraps it with the Firefox GM compatibility layer. No line
number or shell-text extraction is involved. `--check` performs an exact parity
comparison and exits nonzero on drift.

**Do not hand-edit `extension/content.js`.** It is a build artifact. Changes belong in `ghost-in-the-loop.user.js`.

---

## Test Harness — Two Tiers

### Tier 1: Unit tests (jest + jsdom) — `tests/*.test.js`

The userscript is an IIFE — tests can't access its locals directly.
`tests/setup.js` injects an export hook string into the instrumented source just before the closing `})()`. The hook uses `eval(name)` inside the closure to read locals and writes them to a `__GITL_TEST_SINK__` object passed in from the VM context.

**Run:** `npm test` (41 suites / 490 tests)

**Covers:**
- Signal engine, Timeline, verified tab lease, send transactions, redaction,
  export contracts, config/Workshop rollback, Capsule preservation, and health
  scoring.
- Structural/static analysis, generated-source parity, schema and injection
  invariants.

**Cannot catch:** boot-order bugs — jsdom always has `document.body`, so `document-start` timing crashes are invisible here.

### Tier 2: E2E boot/send safety (Playwright) — `tests/e2e/*.spec.js`

Injects the userscript via `addInitScript` (runs at `document-start`, before HTML parse) against `tests/e2e/mock-chat.html`. This is the ONLY tier that catches the class of bug where top-level DOM mutation crashes because `head`/`body` are null.

**Run:** `npm run test:e2e` (requires installed Chromium and Firefox browser
binaries; GitHub Actions installs both)

**Covers:**
- Script survives `document-start` injection without throwing
- Panel mounts to DOM after boot
- Styles inject without null-head crash
- Boot writes a timeline event (proves script reached end of `safeBoot`)
- DOM read of assistant message
- Trusted Types boot behavior and Send-target safety reproductions

**Why this tier exists:** the v7.0.0-patch2 boot crash (see DEVLOG) shipped
because unit tests cannot simulate injection timing. Firefox also exercises the
Gecko/Trusted Types path that previously escaped Chromium-only validation.

**Mobile projects (v8.7):** `mobile-chromium` (Pixel 7 descriptor) and
`mobile-firefox` (touch + 412×915 + Android Firefox UA) run `mobile-*.spec.js`
only; desktop projects ignore them, so suite cost stays flat. Mobile specs use
`page.route` to serve host-accurate mocks so the real reviewed platform
profiles engage (the SEND-001 mobile-send class — desktop projects could never
reproduce it because the DOM differs by UA/viewport/touch).

**Naming convention:** unit tests = `.test.js` (jest), e2e tests = `.spec.js` (Playwright). They never collide — jest's `testMatch` is scoped to `.test.js` only.

### Still NOT covered by either tier
- Real AI site DOM (selectors drift per deployment) — test manually on ChatGPT + Claude before shipping adapter changes
- Real SSE network interception
- Tab lock across genuinely separate browser tabs (e2e uses one context)

---

## Network Interceptor Endpoints

```js
'/backend-api/conversation'   // ChatGPT (legacy)
'/backend-api/f/conversation' // ChatGPT (current — the /f/ segment; added v8.7 after the audit found trusted pulses never fired on live ChatGPT)
'/api/organizations'          // Claude
'/socket.io/'                 // Perplexity
'/api/v1/chat/completions'    // DeepSeek / OpenAI-compatible
'/api/v0/chat/completion'     // DeepSeek (current)
'/chat/conversation'          // HuggingChat
'/api/chat'                   // Generic
'/bard'                       // Gemini
'batchexecute'                // Gemini (current streaming transport)
'/turn/'                      // Copilot
```

The interceptor supplements DOM detection — it does NOT replace it. Sending still requires DOM selector resolution. The interceptor improves response detection latency and reliability, especially on platforms with virtualized DOM that re-renders messages.

## Known Platform Quirks

| Platform | Issue | Current handling |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Claude | ProseMirror editor — `innerHTML = ''` destroys it | `injectText` uses execCommand or dispatchEvent |
| Perplexity | ProseMirror same issue | Same fix |
| Manus | Virtualized chat may omit or repeat rendered turns | Harvest scrolls; DOM export remains `partial`; Capsule preserves repeats instead of deleting them |
| ChatGPT | Has native API export endpoint | `apiExportChatGPT()` validates supported-turn counts; DOM fallback is visibly `partial` |
| Gemini | Send button selector drifts with deployments | Reviewed selectors only; no heuristic actuator promotion; real-device failures remain device-testable |
| Copilot | Uses `/turn/` SSE endpoint | Covered by network interceptor |
